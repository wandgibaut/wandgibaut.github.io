## Multimodal Machine Learning Group - Neurosymbolic AI front

The objective of this groups is to study and explore Neurosymblic AI approaches, aiming to solve Deep Learning challenges, such "blackbox effect". 

Currently, we're exploring Fairness applications using constraints on networks and working with real, social datasets.
