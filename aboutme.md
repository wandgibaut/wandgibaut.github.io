My name is Wandemberg Gibaut, a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence with skills and interests in:

- Robotics

- Internet of Things

Among other things that I would be less comfortable to work with, but still would take the challenge.


This page - and this whole site - is under construction and should be constantly updated. Feel free to send any questions or suggestions to me! :)

### My story

### Credits on the site

despite being a fork from [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/) beautiful jerkyl template, this site contains more than a few ideas from the webepage of [Olivia Guest](https://oliviaguest.com/). I did not fork her directly, but I must still give her credits for code snippets.
