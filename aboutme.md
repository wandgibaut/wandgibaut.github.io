- LLMs

Among other things, I would be less comfortable to work with but still would take the challenge.

### Credits on the site

despite being a fork from [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/) beautiful jerkyl template, this site contains more than a few ideas from the webepage of [Olivia Guest](https://oliviaguest.com/). I did not fork her directly, but I must still give her credit for code snippets.
