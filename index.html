  Hi! My name is Wandemberg Gibaut and I'm a doctor in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I'm working as a researcher in Industry.
  Here you can find information about my work and some small personal projects.

  This page is a work in progress, so please contact me if you have any questions. Also, it's been difficult to allocate time to update the blog (in Portuguese), but I will be updating it soon.
